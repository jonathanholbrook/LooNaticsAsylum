Dont even mention the countless number of listed sources that appear on screen, the majority of which don't actually deliver what
they say or even worse, deliver nothing at all !! I know, why not let Loonatics 3000 filter all the bad ones out for you. It's all done in the
background without you ever noticing.[/COLOR]

[B][I] [COLORdeepskyblue]Stopped [COLORblue]Location[/I][/B][/COLOR]
[COLORlightsteelblue]*If there are so many sources for the one movie, then why is the last stopped location saved for only one of them ?  Problem solved,
*no matter which source you selected KODI will ask you if you want to continue from where you stopped and then automatically start.[/COLOR]

[COLORlightsteelblue]Loonatics 3000 can take scrapers from any addon  for example : Exodus Redux, Seren, Gaia, Universal Scrapers, Openscrapers etc.  Simply
put the information into - 'plugin.video.loonatics3000\resources\done' folder and that, as they say, is that.

One minor exception :
These new scrapers (that are basicly the same) like Openscrapers change their import location, so to use them just change it back.
For example: Change the import point which would look something like 'from openscrapers.modules' to 'from resources.lib.modules'.
For the moment however, Loonatics 3000 has all the available working scrapers from all of the best addons.[/COLOR]
